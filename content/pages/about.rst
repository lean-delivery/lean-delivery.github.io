``We have a dream that one day time-to-market for our solutions will be days
instead of months. That is why we have started creating Lean Delivery
Initiative. It is to help DMs, SAs, TechLeads and DevOps engineers who
work on Hybris, Sitecore, AEM, or Oracle Commerce projects and other
commerce platforms to move faster.``

Who we are?
------------
We are Digital Engagement Practice @ EPAM

We have thousands of gifted engineers and hundreds of projects in the
Digital Engagement domain. And we expect further growth.




Why are we doing this?
----------------------
What if you have the solution that saves your time and effort, the tool that
shortens time to market from months to days, saving your client’s money for
better project use? What if you get it… for free?
For Project and Delivery Managers, for Solution Architects and Tech Leads,
for all engineers who doesn't want to spend their time on reinventing the wheel
we put together the best of our real production practice – all to share it with
you in this Lean Delivery Blog.
Why we do this? Being engineers in our core, we have spent many years being
involved into complex projects, continuously seeking for a better solution and
ideal recipe. As a result, this Program provides a broad set of elements and
processes based on best practices and guidelines to support quick and stable
delivery. Here we advise you on how to simplify your work using Lean principles.
It’s our 10+ years’ experience in a concentrated form, nothing superfluous – only the essence.
What does it give to you? Free time to learn new tools, technologies and
approaches, balance of efforts and quality, faster shipping time and more.
If the questions like “What Git-flow to choose?”, “How to manage project-related
infrastructure?” or “Where and how should we store infrastructure configuration?”
still bother you – let’s come to solve the task together.
